# Tailwind CSS Setup for Backend Developers

## Overview

This theme uses **Tailwind CSS v4.1 CLI**. Please follow the steps below to compile and use the styles in Drupal.

## 1. Install Dependencies

Run this command in the theme root:

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Build Tailwind CSS

For a one-time build:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./assets/css/input.css -o ./assets/css/style.css
```

For development (auto-rebuild on file changes):

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./assets/css/input.css -o ./assets/css/style.css --watch
```

## 3. Drupal Integration

In `mytheme.libraries.yml`:

```yaml
global-styling:
  css:
    theme:
      css/style.css: {}
```

Clear cache:

```bash
drush cr
```

## Notes

- Do not edit `css/style.css` manually â€” it is generated by Tailwind.
- Ensure the `css/` folder exists before running the build command.
